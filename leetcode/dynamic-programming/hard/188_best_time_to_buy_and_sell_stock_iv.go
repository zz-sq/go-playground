 * Total Submissions: 537.6K
 * Testcase Example:  '2\n[2,4,1]'
 *
 * You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a
 * given stock on the i^th day, and an integer k.
 *
 * Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k
 * transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.
 *
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you
 * must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit
 * = 4-2 = 2.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit
 * = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3),
 * profit = 3-0 = 3.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= k <= 100
 * 1 <= prices.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= prices[i] <= 1000
 *
